// FilterStatsByReplicationLag filters the list of TabletHealth by TabletHealth.Stats.SecondsBehindMaster.
// Note that TabletHealth that is non-serving or has error is ignored.
//
// The simplified logic:
// - Return tablets that have lag <= lowReplicationLag.
// - Make sure we return at least minNumTablets tablets, if there are enough one with lag <= highReplicationLagMinServing.
// For example, with the default of 30s / 2h / 2, this means:
// - lags of (5s, 10s, 15s, 120s) return the first three
// - lags of (30m, 35m, 40m, 45m) return the first two
// - lags of (2h, 3h, 4h, 5h) return the first one
//
// The legacy algorithm (default for now):
// - Return the list if there is 0 or 1 tablet.
// - Return the list if all tablets have <=30s lag.
// - Filter by replication lag: for each tablet, if the mean value without it is more than 0.7 of the mean value across all tablets, it is valid.
// - Make sure we return at least minNumTablets tablets (if there are enough one with only low replication lag).
// - If one tablet is removed, run above steps again in case there are two tablets with high replication lag. (It should cover most cases.)
// For example, lags of (5s, 10s, 15s, 120s) return the first three;
// lags of (30m, 35m, 40m, 45m) return all.
//
// One thing to know about this code: vttablet also has a couple flags that impact the logic here:
// * unhealthy_threshold: if replication lag is higher than this, a tablet will be reported as unhealthy.
//   The default for this is 2h, same as the discovery_high_replication_lag_minimum_serving here.
// * degraded_threshold: this is only used by vttablet for display. It should match
//   discovery_low_replication_lag here, so the vttablet status display matches what vtgate will do of it.
