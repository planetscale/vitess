### alter vitess_migration ... cleanup
A new query is supported:
```sql
alter vitess_migration '9748c3b7_7fdb_11eb_ac2c_f875a4d24e90' cleanup
```
This query tells Vitess that a migration's artifacts are good to be cleaned up asap. This allows Vitess to free disk resources sooner. As reminder, once a migration's artifacts are cleaned up, the migration is no
longer revertible.
