# available if desired, but it's disabled at startup.

# If the -enable_semi_sync flag is used, VTTablet will enable semi-sync
# at the proper time when replication is set up, or when masters are
# promoted or demoted.

# prevent alternate futures when doing a failover in response to
# a master that becomes unresponsive.
